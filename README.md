Econometrics homework at Kyoto Univ, 2016 winter

## First public repository

Decided to put my works on GitHub from now on because

1. easier to manage and archive my works, instead of syncing anymore.

2. it will make it easier to organize my codes so I would like to read it again...

3. to get more used to pushing and pulling.
